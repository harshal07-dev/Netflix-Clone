# Netflix Clone

This is a **Netflix clone** built with **ReactJS**. It showcases my understanding of various React concepts and is an excellent project for learning React.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The Netflix Clone is a fully functional web application that mimics the look and feel of Netflix. The app features:
- A **responsive layout** that adapts to various screen sizes.
- A **navbar** with links and dynamic user interactions.
- A **hero section** with a movie banner, caption, and action buttons.
- **Categorized movie sections** displayed in a horizontally scrollable carousel.
- A **login page** that switches between **Sign In** and **Sign Up** forms using **React states** and **conditional rendering**.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Learned
### 1. **React States**
This project helped me understand how React **states** work, particularly in the context of user interactions like toggling between Sign In and Sign Up forms. I used React's `useState` hook to manage form data and UI states.

### 2. **Conditional Rendering**
I used **conditional rendering** to toggle between the **Sign In** and **Sign Up** forms. This allowed me to dynamically display content based on user actions and manage different views within the same component.

### 3. **Responsive Layouts**
The project taught me how to build a fully **responsive layout** using **CSS media queries** and **flexbox** to ensure the app looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.



This helped me get comfortable with breaking down a project into reusable, self-contained components.
